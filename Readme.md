# Usage:

## Simplest

On a RHEL9/Alma9/EL9 host this will drop you into a CentOS7 sandbox for development

> ./appBox -ra

If you want root access to the same sandbox you can use:

> ./appBox -rar

### What did this do?

Thie downloaded the docker image _"centos:7"_ from dockerhub. Extracted it as a sandbox. Made some changes to make sure it works well. And then openned an interactive terminal within this sandbox environment.

### What else can it do?

You can configure what image it downloads from dockerhub. You can configure 'where it installs the image to' and you can configure a few other useful things.


## More advanced Usage

> ./appBox -ii tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-jupyter -ip $HOME/tf-w-gpu-support -rar -add_nv

This will grab the latest tensorflow image from dockerhub which has been installed with working GPU support and jupyter notebooks.
It will install it into your home area within a folder you choose.
It will mount some nvidia components from the host into the sandbox.
Finally it will drop into a pseudo-root terminal within this sandbox.
All without needing local root/admin access.




# FAQs:

## Why does this exist?

This exists to fill the gap in the between what I want and what userland Podman and Singularity/Apptainer do.

These are awesome tools in their own right, but relying on seeing up group mapping for users on a cluster is just plain annoying.

Yes this tool isn't perfect. Yes this tool does lots of things ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. But frankly this is also the only tool where I can type a *single sort command* and drop into pseudo-root to install applications into a sandbox guest across various hosts without the admin having to worry about what packages are installed or permissions have been granted*.

(*obviously without namespaces we're dead on the water, but then we're doing computing asif it's the late 90s again ;) )

## What does this do?

This tool installs a ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù but mutable sandbox environment for a userspace command to execute pseudo privileged commands within a containerised kernel namespaces. 

## What does that mean?

Think of this as being a half way house between Docker and VirtualBox.

But we still need Linux.

Because the penguin is awesome!

Long live the penguin!!!

## Why does this exist?

My commuting career started by cutting my teeth on the SL5 EOL. That was a bit of a mess.

I survived the SL6 EOL by keeping my heads down in the trenches and letting someone else deal with it.

Frankly we still haven't learned all of the lessons in time for the SL7 EOL‚Ä¶

To be clear we're in a better situation, but we haven't communicated the difficulty of this work to funding councils etc effectively. The EOL of win10 has received more funding and attention IMHO. (Probably because there's already a big fat stack of cash involved‚Ä¶)

## What do I need to install this?

Modern Linux and Python3 is likely enough. 

## But what do I actually need to install this?

Technically you also need user namespaces enabled, beyond that, this tool makes no effort to use network namespaces because that confuses users more than it helps. Besides if you want that just use a proper container orchestration tool like Docker/Podman/k8s/k3s/Azure/EC2/iCloud/‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶

## Is this a security tool?

No.

This is about giving more power back to the normative mean of users who don't care about kernel namespaces and want to use a computer to do a job.

If you're an admin scared by this good. FIX YOUR SECURITY MODEL.

## Would this be better if I used package X?

Yes, almost certainly. This can all be mitigated by having admin access on a system.

The intention is for this tool to run ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù on a Fedora/EL/Ubuntu/Debian(?)/‚Ä¶ modern Linux host.  (You are running a supported secure release aren't you üòù)

This project is intended to ‚Äújust work‚Äù on as many machines as possible which just have python3 installed.

## Why not just use this awesome python package Y?

See above.

## Why not use ‚Äîmap-{u,g}id?

At the time of writing, I'm aiming to support F39/Alma9/Ubuntu22. Not all of these systems have back ported or updated to a version of util for Linux where this is supported as a single user.

That being said, correctly mapping the user and group accounts requires managing the /etc/{passwd,group} files anyway so I'm yet to be convinced that doing anything other than mapping unknown to a user is any better. (Other than for some situations where software might be detecting this particular uig/gid‚Ä¶ to quote team America ‚ÄúThat's bad intelligence, very bad‚Äù)

## What is this tool?

appBox is a pure Python3 standalone userland sandboxing tool.

There are plenty of tools that do containerisation (for both users and admins), that have superior isolation to make systems more secure. These are all excellent tools at doing their jobs.

Some even support running userland containers. However, almost all require some level of setup/permissions/config from an admin who will (rightly imo!) get concerned when a user asks for elevated permissions across computing clusters or managed systems. 

Creating a user land sandbox allows you to ‚Äúinstall a container as a virtualenv‚Äù.

This allows you to drop into an Ubuntu OS from Fedora or Redhat on Debian, install packages, compile and run tools.

## What is this not?

This is not a tool for providing isolation.

This is a tool for managing system level networking applications.

This is not a tool designed to work with/instead-of Kubernetes.

This is not a chicken.

This is not the droids you are looking for‚Ä¶

## How does this work?

Step 1) This app initializes a new set of namespaces as root within the host.

Step 2) Then the space is entered and bind mounts and other settings are initialized to create the sandbox.

Step 3) Finally the sandbox namespace is initialized within a pseudo terminal as either ‚Äòanon‚Äô/‚Äôroot‚Äô mappings‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

Step ?) Profit?

## What fixes does this apply?

This sandbox attempts to remove sandboxing within the OS at a settings level.

## Why doesn't this support X?

Good question, feel free to email me. 

## I insist you to drop everything and support Y.

That's nice but I don't have the time to 'drop everything'.
